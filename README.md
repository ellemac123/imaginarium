# WIP: Imaginarium Card Categories Personal Project

This project was created to categorise the cards for the Russian board game Imaginarium. 
I own six very different decks and I want to mix them up, but would like to know
which original decks they came in, in case I ever want to reorganise. So here is this project. 
It is a work in progress, as I have very little time to contribute to this project, but
hopefully one day I will be able to mix my cards up and have one MASSIVE deck!
